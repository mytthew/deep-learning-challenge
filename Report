For this part of the assignment, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
-

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
-The variable I targeted for this assignment was the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column from th application_df.

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
-I used all of the other columns as the features. That is why I dropped the target columb from the dataframe. 

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
-The assignment instructes told us to remove the 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns from the dataset. 

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
-I used 9 hidden nodes for the first layer and 18 hidden nodes for the second layer. Honestly, I am not sure why I chose these numbers, but it seems it did end up working out. 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
-Unfortunately Not. I ended up around 73%. 

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
-

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
-I fell short of the 75% threshold by just 2%. If I had more time I would adjust the number of nodes and nuerons and see if that would increase the performance of the model.
